# Laptop Store Application
A simple online laptop store. This project is a quick demonstration of node.js features.

## Getting Started
Dowload and save the project folder locally. Open shell or terminal to the project folder path and run command line:

`npm install`

Once all required packages have been downloaded, run the following command line:

`nodemon` 

This should start listening for access type activity on the server. To check if this is working, open up your browser (preferrably chrome) and type the following inside the adress bar:

`127.0.0.1:1337`
